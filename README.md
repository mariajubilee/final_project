# Perceptions of Masculinity from Queer and Straight Males 
by Jubilee Heutmaker

I found this data set from FiveThirtyEight on Github. Ella Koeze and Anna Maria Barry-Jester used the dataset to write What Do Men Think It Means To Be A Man? The data was collected via  SurveyMonkey and contains responses from 1,615 men. The Github page where I downloaded the CSV showed that, “The modeled error estimate for this survey is plus or minus 2.5 percentage points. The percentages have been weighted for age, race, education, and geography using the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey to reflect the demographic composition of the United States age 18 and over.” As FiveThirtyEight already wrote an article using this data, I did not have to do much to get it in a workable format other than upload the CSV file into Google Sheets. After a great length of time spent on interrogating the data and looking for threads, I deleted the columns unrelated to my chosen topic to visually pair down the data. 

The first question in the survey is: “In general, how masculine or ‘manly’ do you feel?” Participants could respond on a sliding scale from “Not at all masculine” to “Very Masculine.” I sorted by sexual orientation and created a pivot table with the responses to Question 1. After grouping together those that answered “Gay” and “Bisexual” into one category of “Queer,” I changed the count of responses into a percentage of the whole (within the distinct categories of either Queer or Straight). Looking at the first bar chart, 39% of Straight men reported that they felt “Very masculine,” while only 23% of Queer men reported they felt “Very masculine.”  Also, only 7% of Straight men reported feeling “Not very masculine”, while double the percentage (14%) of Queer men reported feeling “Not very masculine.”

The second question of the survey asked, “How important is it to you that others see you as masculine?” Participants could respond on the sliding scale from “Not at all important” to “Very Important.” While my own personal bias thought there would be a major difference in the aggregated responses of Queer and Straight men, the second bar chart illustrates that there is not a visually large difference in Queer and Straight responses. (I make this claim based on visuals alone and have not done the statistical significance analysis.) Sometimes showing the lack of difference is important! Perhaps Queer and Straight males equally feel the pressure (or lack of pressure) to appear masculine.

Another question in the survey asks participants to choose the frequency with which they do the following activities. The survey questions looked like this:

 How often would you say you do each of the following? [RANDOMIZE, matrix] 
Ask a friend for professional advice 
Ask a friend for personal advice 
Express physical affection to male friends, like hugging, rubbing shoulders 
Cry 
Get in a physical fight with another person 
Have sexual relations with women, including anything from kissing to sex 
Have sexual relations with men, including anything from kissing to sex 
Watch sports of any kind 
Work out 
See a therapist 
Feel lonely or isolated

Participants could answer any of the following responses:
Often 
Sometimes 
Rarely 
Never, but open to it 
Never, and not open to it 


I chose a few of the above behaviors/activities to further analyze.The first pie chart is a breakdown of responses from both Queer and Straight men on how frequently they express physical affection to male friends like hugging or giving a shoulder rub. Among Queer men, 38% responded as “Often” while only 12% of Straight men responded as “Often.” While only 2-3% of Queer males responded with “Never, and not open to it,” 21% of Straight males responded “Never, and not open to it.”

</script>

The second pie chart is a breakdown of responses from both Queer and Straight men on how frequently they cry. While 13% of Queer men reported that they cry often, only 3-4% of Straight males reported that they cry often.

</script>

The third pie chart is a breakdown of responses from both Queer and Straight men on how frequently they ask a friend for personal advice. While only 11% of Straight males reported that they asked a friend for personal advice often, nearly double (23%) of Queer males reported that they asked a friend for personal advice often.

</script>

While all of these charts and statistics are interesting, no conclusive statement can be made about the accuracy of these self reported data.
